# Wireframe 0.1.0

> Web Application template.

This is a MERN stack application. 

It is a small wireframe web application template that includes authentication, profiles and forum posts.
The idea is to have a quick out of the box application with Login, Security, State, Routing and Database storage.

The Web Application is being hosted on Heroku.
The backend database is MongoDB.
The client is written in Reactjs
The Web Application state is in React-Redux


## Mern Stack
MongoDB - Express - React - Nodejs

## Installation

```
# Add the URI to the config/default.json file identifing the mongoDB.
# Example

```

```bash
# Install server dependencies

# Install client dependencies
cd client
